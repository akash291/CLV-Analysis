Analyzing Customer lifetime value of a car insurance company to provide insight for betterment of business policies.

THE TASK:
We want to build a model using R programming that allows the insurance company to predict customer lifetime value for all given customer.In 
our dataset,we have customer lifetime value which is “the present value of the future cash flows attributed to the customer during his/her 
entire relationship with the company.”
The resulting model will be used to forecast CLV and guide the insurance in future marketing campaigns.
